# Background music

Place your background music file here:

- **File name:** `bg-music.mp3`
- **Full path:** `public/audio/bg-music.mp3`

The app will load it at `/audio/bg-music.mp3`. Supported formats: MP3 (recommended for broad support). Loop is enabled.

If the file is missing, the play/pause button still appears; playback will fail silently until you add the file.
